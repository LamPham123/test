# Data Sonification Toolkit

**Organization:** University of Washington, Interactive Data Lab (IDL)

**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Svelte, D3.js

**Duration:** January 2025 – June 2025

## Overview

An open-source toolkit that makes data accessible through sound, designed to help researchers create data-driven audio narratives with an intuitive block-based interface.

## Key Features

### Queuing System
- Developed a sophisticated queuing system in TypeScript for the data sonification library
- Designed specifications for sequencing text, audio, and scale mappings
- Enables flexible creation of data-driven narratives through sound

### Svelte-Based Toolkit
- Built intuitive block-based interface for researchers
- Integrated D3.js visualizations for visual feedback
- Real-time audio feedback during sonification creation
- Streamlined workflow reduces time to create accessible data narratives

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Detailed API documentation for developers
- Supports future development and external library integration

## Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript:** Type-safe queuing system with clear specifications
- **Svelte:** Reactive UI framework for smooth user experience
- **D3.js:** Data visualization library for visual-audio synchronization
- **Web Audio API:** Browser-native audio synthesis and playback

## Impact

- Makes data more accessible to visually impaired users
- Provides researchers with tools to create multi-modal data presentations
- Contributes to open-source accessibility ecosystem
- Enables new forms of data storytelling through sound

## Research Applications

- Scientific data presentation
- Educational data visualization
- Accessibility-focused data journalism
- Multi-sensory data exploration tools

## Documentation

- Complete API documentation for developers
- Usage examples and tutorials
- Integration guides for external libraries
