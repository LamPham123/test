Today marks day 3 in my journey of learning how to swim. The morning was a slow one. I opened my eyes, saw 6:38am, set a 2 hour and 17 minute timer, and closed my eyes once again. The timer went off, I opened my phone, checked some lame emails, read some introspective fancy shmancy quotes and stories on substack, and finally got out of bed. I packed my swim trunks, swim cap, goggles, and began my trek to Denny Hall.

I started with my lime scooter. The camera inside the app wasn’t working, so I input the scooter name into my phone and rode off towards campus as I was already around 15 minutes late to my 50 minute class. The break on this scooter was also lopsided, meaning the right side of the break was constantly scraping against the floor and I was terrified that could be launched off at any moment. At the end of my ride, the camera was still not working, and as a result, I lost around 4 more dollars than I should’ve to idle minutes on my lime. I submit a complaint on the app and quickly rushed to class.

After 30 minutes of blah blah blah my class wraps up, and my journey continues to the pool. The thick smell of chlorine and the humid air of the pool still surprises me. I jump in, and the shock of the cold water hits me like a balloon that was rubbed on someones head too many times. It never gets any easier.

To start this session, my coach decided that we do warm up with 100m free, 50m kick board, and 50m pull buoy. “Pfft. Easy.” I mustered, with a twisted look on my face. I was certain that it would not be easy. 8 grueling minutes later, I find my gasping for air, panting like a silly dog after a long chase. My coach exchanges a smile with me, a kind that was unimpressed but proud at the same time.

She mentions to me that i kinda suck a breathing, which I am well aware of. We take some time to fix it. I position my hands on the wall, kicking my feet out away from it. The idea is that I should be able to stay afloat, rotate my head, take a breath, and put my head back down in to swimming position.

Everything that could have went wrong, went wrong. As I pointed my ear to the sky, the water rushed inside like a kid on Christmas morning. I opened my mouth and drank what felt like all of the pacific ocean. I spazzed up out of the water, coughing, shaking my head, and slapping the side of my face to get the water our of my system.

My coach, on the other hand, was having the time of her life. If uncontrollably laughing at her students failures was apart of the job description, I could see why she standing in front of me that day. “Slow down!” she coughed in between bursts of more laughter.

In that moment, I realized 3 things.

One. Wow I suck.

Two. As the laughter echoed around the pool, I couldn’t help but smile. Unfortunate situations aren’t all bad.

Three. She was right. I should totally slow down.

I mentioned this yesterday, but now that I am slightly addicted to this app, I try really hard to look at life as something to write about. On my journey home, I thought about that moment a lot. Forgive me for over analyzing and over romanticizing my life, but I thought about what does it mean to slow down? In swimming, it means to not drink the pool like its a free slurpee on 7/11. In life… what does that look like? Should I intentionally not be thinking about my future just to focus on the now and try to be present? Should I try and forget about my past, so that I may grow and move on? As I sat down at the bus stop, I took off my airpods and pondered this thought. I took a look around, and I didn’t really find an answer.

However, I found that Seattle Fall is unexplainably beautiful. The leaves this year are catching my attention like an overheard quote. The air seems to be whispering to each other about something. Maybe the breeze is expressing how excited it is to be back. Maybe the leaves are going through growing pains. Maybe that the tree that once felt like home to two lovers is now lonely.

Maybe, what slowing down means is that there is no rush to find the answer. I could ask myself more and more questions that I definitely don’t have the answer to, or I can just sit and experience everything around. Maybe I’ll find that me and my surroundings have a little bit more in common than I thought we did.
